N/B: kubectl apply -f . to run all the config files when you dont want to use skaffold
========== Scaffold =====================
1. Automates many task in Kubernetes dev environment
2. Makes it easy to update code in a running pod
3. Makes it really easy to create and delete all objects tied to a project at once

confirm installation of Scaffold by entering : scaffold

=========== How it works ========
1. Its 'apply' all the files in >>infra/k8s when it is started
2. Its 'apply' the files whenever there is any change in any of the files
3. Deletes all the objects related to all the files in >>infra/k8s when it is stopped. So if you are working on multiple microservice projects, when stopped, it cleans up all the objects in a particular ms and lets you work on other projects

===========Start skaffold ===
After completing the skaffold.yaml config, run skaffold dev on your terminal, this might take alot of time.
1. skaffold dev
